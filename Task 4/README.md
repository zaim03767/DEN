# Image Classification Using CNN
A machine learning project to classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Description
This project involves building an image classification model using CNN techniques. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and implemented in a Jupyter notebook.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: CIFAR-10
- **Description**: The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Code
- **Notebook**: `Img_Classification_CNN.ipynb`
- **Description**: Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zaim03767/DEN.git
   cd DEN
2. **Open the Notebook**: Access the `Img_Classification_CNN.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed for seamless execution.
4. **Execution**: Run all cells in the notebook to witness the results and insights.
