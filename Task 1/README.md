# House Price Prediction

This directory contains files related to Task 1 of the DEP Machine Learning Internship. The project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model trained on housing data.

## Project Description

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features in the dataset. The model is implemented in a Jupyter notebook.

## Files Included

- **Housing.csv:** Dataset containing housing information.
- **Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook for predicting house prices.

## Dataset

- **Filename:** `Housing.csv`
- **Description:** Contains information about houses, including features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, main road access, guestroom, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishing status.

## Code

- **Notebook:** `Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb`
- **Description:** Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zaim03767/DEP.git
   cd DEP
2. **Open the Notebook**: Access the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed for seamless execution.
4. **Execution**: Run all cells in the notebook to witness the results and insights.
