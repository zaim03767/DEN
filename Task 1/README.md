# House Price Prediction

This directory contains files related to Task 1 of the DEP Machine Learning Internship. The project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model trained on housing data.

## Project Description

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features in the dataset. The model is implemented in a Jupyter notebook.

## Files Included

- **Housing.csv:** Dataset containing housing information.
- **Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook for predicting house prices.

## Dataset

- **Filename:** `Housing.csv`
- **Description:** Contains information about houses, including features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, main road access, guestroom, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking, prefarea, and furnishing status.

## Code

- **Notebook:** `Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb`
- **Description:** Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation
