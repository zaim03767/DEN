# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using a dataset of customer information and a classification model.

## Project Description

This project involves building a customer churn prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of customer information and implemented in a Jupyter notebook.

## Dataset

- **Filename:** `telecom_churn.csv`
- **Description:** Contains customer data including features related to their service usage and demographic information.

## Code

- **Notebook:** `Customer_Churn.ipynb`
- **Description:** Jupyter notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zaim03767/DEN.git
   cd DEN
2. **Open the Notebook**: Access the `Customer_Churn.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed for seamless execution.
4. **Execution**: Run all cells in the notebook to witness the results and insights.
